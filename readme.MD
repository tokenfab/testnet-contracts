    To verify the contract, use file ends with Verify.sol
3. migrations

# Creating and deploying contract
Call the below sample api. Then you can see the new contract at etherscan.
```
curl -X POST http://localhost:7070/wallet/deploy -d '{"txKey":"1","chainId":"sepolia","tokenName":"TTNF","contractOwner":"0x2a2089e50CB2F0354fD8018C8fcC7538644e3673","contractTemplate":"FNFT1","manageType":"3","contractName":"TurnTurbine","precision":0,"contractPatameters":[{"name":"#NAME","value":"Turn Turbine"},{"name":"#URI","value":"https://nft.turnturbine.io/api/v1/tokens/"},{"name":"#MAXSUPPLY","value":"1000"},{"name":"#FNFT","value":"TurnTurbine"},{"name":"#TOKEN","value":"TTNF"}]}'
```
